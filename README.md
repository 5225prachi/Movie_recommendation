# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

### ✨ Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is a Python-based application that utilizes the MovieLens dataset to provide personalized movie recommendations. By analyzing average ratings, filtering movies with at least 50 ratings, and showcasing top-rated films, the system presents valuable insights into the best movies for users. The project also includes visual data representations using four different types of graphs to make the results more interactive and easy to understand.

### 🚀 Features

- **🎥 Top Movie Recommendations:** Displays a list of the top-rated movies based on average ratings.
- **📊 Movie Filters:** Filters movies with at least 50 ratings to ensure the recommendations are based on a substantial number of reviews.
- **⭐ Average Ratings Display:** Shows the average ratings of the movies, helping users identify highly rated films.
- **📈 Graphical Insights:** Includes four types of graphs (e.g., bar charts, scatter plots, histograms) for better visual analysis of the movie dataset.
- **🔍 Interactive System:** Provides personalized suggestions based on the dataset, helping users discover new movies to watch.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core language for processing data and building the recommendation system.
- **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis, handling the MovieLens dataset.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Used for creating various visualizations and graphs.
- **MovieLens Dataset:** Source of movie data, including ratings, genres, and movie details.
